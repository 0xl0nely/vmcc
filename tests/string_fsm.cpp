/*
    there are a few ways to implement a finite state machine. one of them is to create a
    transition table, which is a 2d array which contains each state on the 1st dimension, and
    each possible input on the second dimension.

    this implementation however, will take up a LOT LOT LOT of memory, especially when the pattern
    length increases, the amount of memory and computation we must perform increases exponetially.
